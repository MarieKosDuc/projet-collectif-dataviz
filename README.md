# Dataviz project - a jokes, memes and info webpage

By Marie Koscianski-Ducharlet, Helder Neves Da Silva Ferreira and Nolwen Major Francès during our studies at [Ada Tech School](https://adatechschool.fr/)

## Project overview

This two-week group project aimed to get us to learn how to use web APIs, during a 2-week sprint. We were free to chose which API to call using JavaScript, and to design a webpage however we wished using the returned data using HTML/CSS.

## Challenges

Our initial goal was to create a job-board for our class at Ada Tech School, which would present the apprenticeship offers in the Paris region.

After a false start trying to fetch a Pôle Emploi (french public agency for employment) API using a OAUTH identification protocol, we reckoned this was technically much too complicated after less than two months of trainin in software engineering, and decided to start again using more simple APIs.

We ended up combining a few REST API (meme API, tech jokes API, tech news API, current weater API) and focused on integrating the data into a user-friendly page, which background changes based on the weather data.
